## Description: The mini-project teach me to scroll animation. And when and how to trigger something on and off.

## **Pros :**

- animate scroll by just vanillaJs

- no heavy weighted library needed

- ```javascript
   used function/methods [window.innerHeight ,element.getBoundingClientRect()]
  ```

## **Cons :**

- Had to hardcode
